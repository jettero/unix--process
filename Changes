   - a few tweaks and bug fixes (mostly doc bugs)
   - added new meta.yml stuff

1.31: 
   - I used a perl 5.8 syntax in my Makefile.PL
   - although, I think this should work in perl 5.6
     + hrm, looks like IPC::System::Simple doesn't work under
       5.6, at some point they started using the "use if WINDOWS"
       syntax, which I think is from later perls.

   - The autoloader was kinda crappy
   - There were whitespace bugs
   - I hate M::B and went back to EU::MM
     (so I also ditched version.pm)

1.2.1: Mon May 26 15:44:35 EDT 2008
   - I might as well do a new version of everything using
     version.pm while I wait for all my CPAN deletes to go
     through.  I just discovered that version.pm doesn't/didn't
     go core until perl 5.9...  I really wish I'd have prereqed
     it everywhere I used it, but I didn't.  *sigh*

1.2.0: Sat May 24 09:53:04 EDT 2008
   - using version.pm as suggested by Andreas Koenig
   - making the module slightly less platform dependent.
